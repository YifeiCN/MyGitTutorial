### The purpose of this repo:

I have sign up for GitHub account for a long time,  but i haven't used its hosting features until recently. (I won't say I didn't even create a repository before ;)  )

Okey, let me talk about the purpose of this repo and why I do that. **This repo is prepare for those people like me before who can only fork others but don't know how to create repository locally and associate with GitHub.**  

### What can you get through this tutorial:

The official course is very good, but I believe the tutorial I provide is more suitable for noob like me. 

In this tutorial, I will briefly explain how to:

+  Create a locall repository
+ Associate files with the repository
+ Update the files
+ Delete the files
+ Associate the local repository with GitHub
+ Submit local repository to GitHub

After do that, I believe you can create your first repository and submit to Github. I believe you will enjoy it. 



PS: This is a really really really brief tutorial, if you have any other needs, please google it.



PPS: Maybe I'll add more things, if I'm not lazy :)
